### SNARL!

Take on the role of a brave adventurer entering the keep of the mighty and avaricious
dragon Betsy who, being the hoarder that she is, stored all the riches of the world into
one cave! Will you be able to come out a billionaire let alone alive?

Snarl is a game where you take on the role of a treasure hunter entering a dangerous,
randomly-generated dungeon full of treasure, a guardian dragon, and a cunning thief
of unknown origin. You will enter absurd rooms, find unusual treasures, encounter traps,
and other obstacles along the way. You must be wary of every action you make as, the slightest
mistake can irk Betsy. The two main inspirations for this game was text-based adventure Zork
and the board game Clank!

Goal: Acquire as much treasure as possible but while making it out of the cave alive. Acquiring
tons of treasure means nothing if you are dead. Dying results in a score of 0 points. That means
that even if you only manage to procure a single gold coin, if you feel the need to escape then
go for it.

Mechanics

1. Betsy's Wrath: Betsy has an anger meter not shown to the player. It is a meter from 1 to 10 where
10 is the highest. Betsy's behavior changes based on her Anger Level. For instance, if her Anger Level is 1, she will be sleeping soundly in a random room of the cave. If her Anger Level is 10, she will be actively hunting down the thieves stealing from her cave to the point of blasting fire to every adjacent room. Hint messages are displayed to the player in relation to Betsy's anger level. For instance, if her Anger Level is 1, the game will display "You hear the noises of deep slumber...". If her Anger Level is 10, the game will display 
"You feel the cave heat up to the point of... woah! Is that your tunic on fire?" 
The player can control Betsy's Wrath indirectly through the clever use of items, the environment, and actions.

2. Gricko: Gricko is an arcane trickster who also came to Betsy's Keep in search of riches and he will not hesitate to take something shiny from your hands either through sleight of hand or violence. The keyword here is "arcane" because whenever he steals something, he often teleports away. After Gricko, has reached a certain maximum value of treasure, he will leave the cave permanently taking those treasures away from the cave. Gricko can be killed or Gricko can kill you. 

3. Treasure and Weight: Treasure is randomly-generated throughout the dungeon.
